# C Collections

This is a small library of data structures.

It futures the following data structures: dynamic array (aka vector), doubly linked list, double-ended queue, hash map, and hash set.

I shall be adding a red-black tree and a binary heap any time soon.

They are mostly for personal use right now, but if you stumble upon it, do as you please, per the license.

Also, the particular design is because these data structures are meant to be used with another library of search and sorting algorithms.
You should start seeing those in the last week of December 2022.

The documentation will be coming after I'm satisfied with the tests.

And a word of caution: the library is _not_ thread-safe as it is not a priority for me right now.
But some time in 2023, I intend to make it so.

Until then, I welcome any feedback!
